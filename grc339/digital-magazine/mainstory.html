                            <h2>The History of Calligraphy</h2>

                                <p>Calligraphy has a long history that can be traced back to the Shang Dynasty’s days, an era that lasted from 1600 to 1046 BC.

As calligraphy developed in China, other parts of the world, such as Egypt, simultaneously developed their own systems. </p>

                                <p>While calligraphy was developing around the globe, each culture held a different finished product and had the same principles.

It had its fair share of rises and falls until it was finally cemented as the art form it truly is.</p>
